Authorize
=========
The authorize plugin extends ActionController with the ability to check permissions and react accordingly.  There are two approaches:
a simple boolean check (permit?) and a more sophisticated predicated block (permit) with exception handling.  In both cases, the method accepts
a permissions description string expressed in a domain-specific language.  The simplest version of this language is just the name of the required 
global/generic role.  For example, using the boolean version:

	permit? "adminstrator"

More complex expressions typically involve requiring a particular role over a particular model instance.  For example:

	permit? "owner of :widget"  

The authorize plugin extends ActiveRecord with two methods: acts_as_subject and acts_as_trustee.  A given model may invoke
either or both, depending on requirements.  The follow narrative shows the methods added to models for management of 
role-based authorization.
 
ActiveRecord-provided associations (see AR documentation for complete list of related methods)
  Trustee (User or Group, for example)
    authorizations
          Returns array of authorizations belonging to trustee
          Deprecated equivalent: roles
    subjected_<subjected_models>   # Note the use of the plural model name
          Returns authorized model objects
          Not yet implemented
  Subject (Widget, for example)
    subjections  # Synonym for authorizations -must be distinct to permit model as both trustee and subject.
          Returns array of authorizations over acts_as_subject objects.
          Deprecated equivalent: accepted_roles
    authorized_<trustee_models>
          Returns array of trustees with an authorization over the acts_as_subject object.
          Not yet implemented
  Authorization
    trustee
          Returns the authorized trustee
    subject
          Returns the object of the authorization
    subjected_<subjected_model>     # Note the use of the singular model name
          Returns subjected model object of named class.  NB: This association is only safe with UUID-keyed models!
          Disabled
    authorized_<authorized_model>      # Note the use of the singular model name
          Returns authorized trustee object of named class.  NB: This association is only safe with UUID-keyed trustees!
          Disabled
Standard plugin methods:
  Trustee
    authorize <Role>, <Subject Instance or Class>
          Creates an authorization for the trustee as <Role> over the subject Instance or Class.  If neither an instance nor a class is specified,
          the trustee is granted a generic/global authorization.
    unauthorize <Role>, <Subject Instance or Class>
          Removes any authorization for the trustee as <Role> over the subject Instance or Class.  Leave off the instance or class to remove a
          generic authorization.
    authorized? <Role>, <Subject Instance or Class>
          Boolean condition for the trustee being authorized as the <Role> over the subject Instance or Class.  Leave off the instance or class to
          check for a generic/global authorization.
  Subject (Authorizable Class or Instance)
    subject <Role>, <Trustee>
          Subjects the model instance or class to the authority of trustee as the named role.
    unsubject <Role>, <Trustee>
          Removes any authorization for the trustee as the named role over the model instance or class
    subjected? <Role>, <Trustee>
          Boolean condition for the the model Instance or Class being subjected to the authority of trustee as the named role.
Identity Mixin methods:
  Trustee
    is_<Role>_for_what
          Returns array of subjects for which trustee as <Role> is authorized
    is_<Role>_<Preposition>?(<Authorizable object>)
          Boolean condition for trustee as <Role> being authorized for the specified subject.
    is_<Role>[_<Preposition> <Authorizable object>]
          Creates authorization for trustee as <Role> either generically or over the specified subject (model or class)
    is_<Role>
          Creates generic authorization to trustee as <Role>
  Subject
    has_<Role>
          Returns array of trustees having specified role over the subject.
    has_<Role>?
          Boolean conditioned upon at least one trustee having <Role> over the subject.
