Per-model permission operations
Index into roles has_many association with relation string
Scrap name attribute and let I18N handle Role#to_s with relation string and reference (I18n.t 'role.MOD', :thing => "Sabre 36")
REDIS: ModelArray and ModelHash (key, value, key/value) like ModelSet
GRAPH: Add UndirectedEdge to make UndirectedGraph's edges more efficient and semantically clean (with one set of properties, not two).
Eliminate reliance on ActiveSupport dependency loader.
